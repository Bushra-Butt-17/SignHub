# 🌟 Sign Language Corpus Crowdsourcing Platform

This project focuses on developing a crowdsourcing platform to create, validate, and manage a comprehensive sign language corpus, particularly for Pakistan Sign Language (PSL). The platform leverages contributions from the deaf community and language experts to build a machine-readable and usable resource for sign language translation and education.
